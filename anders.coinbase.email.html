         We hope this email finds you well.We sent you couple or emails but nevergot a reply. We have received a report on a transaction of $500 you made on <b>2024-02-28</b> at about <b>12:11am</b>, and we also have a pending reversal transfer made on <b>2024-01-28</b> at about <b>5:01pm</b>, to an email address instead of a wallet address. <p> <b>Please note that your reversal sum total is 900 United State Dollars, due to rise and fall of Bitcoin</b></p>                                                                          
          Ignore this if this problem has been resolved. But kindly reply to the email sent to ypu if not you are yet to be refunded, so we can assist you, or better still sum up the total amount that needs to be refunded and then buy the amount in Bitcoin so your money will be added to your balance with the amount you deposited.
